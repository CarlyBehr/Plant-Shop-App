# Plant-Shop-App
For this app interface, I designed three corresponding screens for a mobile plant shop, creating a cohesive and visually engaging experience. The overall aesthetic is centered around a green and earthy theme, complemented by high-quality imagery that enhances the organic and natural feel of the brand. The design prioritizes motion graphics, utilizing smooth transitions between screens and buttons to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

One of the key aspects I focused on was ensuring that the interface felt fluid and intuitive, making navigation seamless for users while maintaining an inviting and modern look. Motion and movement play a significant role in guiding the user’s journey through the app, with animations that add a sense of liveliness and engagement. These transitions not only improve functionality but also contribute to the overall aesthetic, reinforcing the brand’s fresh and natural identity.

As I continue refining this design, I’d love to expand upon the current experience by developing more in-depth product pages. This would allow users to explore plant details more comprehensively, including care instructions, specifications, and even interactive elements such as 360-degree views or augmented reality previews. Adding these layers of depth would enhance usability and provide a richer browsing experience.

A design choice I’ve gone back and forth on is the use of light orange typography, which contrasts with the green tones of the interface. Additionally, I experimented with a bright green accent color for dark mode, aiming for a bold yet balanced look. While these choices add vibrancy, I am considering potential adjustments to refine the color harmony further. These elements may evolve based on usability testing and user feedback, ensuring the final design achieves both aesthetic appeal and functional clarity.
