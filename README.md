# Plant-Shop-App
For this app interface, I designed three corosponding screens for a mobile plant shop app. The theme is suposed to be green and earthy with high quality imagery. With a focus on motion grafics and movement found through screen and button transitions. 
I'd really love to expand on this deisgn experince by adding more indepth pages on the products found. Something i went back and forth on with design was the light orange colored used on the typography as well as the bright green dark mode color. This is something that might chnage.
